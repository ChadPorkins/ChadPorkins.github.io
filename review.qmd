This literature review delves into the relationship between astroturf, temperature increases, health impacts, and climate implications. Specifically, it explores the high temperatures that astroturf can reach, how these elevated temperatures may affect the health of athletes and other users, and the potential climate implications.

Astroturf, initially lauded for its resilience and year-round playability (Kanaan et al., 2020), has garnered growing concerns over time regarding its impact on local temperatures, climate patterns, and health outcomes (Russo et al., 2022; Gould et al., 2022). As the use of astroturf in various recreational settings continues to rise, it becomes crucial to comprehend its implications for temperature dynamics, public health, and climate change (Russo et al., 2022).

Astroturf has gained popularity as an alternative to natural grass in sports facilities, with approximately 24.6 million square meters installed in North America in 2020 (Russo et al., 2022). Originally designed to offer a low-maintenance and cost-effective solution for high schools, colleges, and professional stadiums (Jastifer et al., 2018), its appeal has grown due to the development of new synthetic surfaces, including infill systems that mimic natural turfgrass playing quality (Jastifer et al., 2018). However, this increased adoption of astroturf has raised environmental concerns and athlete well-being issues (Gould et al., 2022). Despite advantages such as low maintenance and minimal irrigation needs, these benefits come with caveats, including improper installation leading to drainage issues and uneven surfaces (Jastifer et al., 2018).

Significant temperature disparities exist between astroturf and natural turfgrass surfaces. Astroturf can be 35-60째C hotter than natural turfgrass under similar conditions (McNitt et al., 2007). This temperature difference is primarily attributed to the synthetic fibers used in astroturf, which absorb solar radiation and have minimal light reflectance, causing surface temperatures to reach as high as 93째C on hot, sunny days (Thoms et al., 2014; McNitt et al., 2007). Astroturf's hydrophobic and compact nature exacerbates heat retention, making it resistant to cooling by wind or water, necessitating frequent irrigation (Kanaan et al., 2020). Cooling a 12.2m by 12.2m field from 60째C to 30째C would require a staggering 480,000 liters of water or 3mm to 5mm of water application, bringing astroturf's water requirements into a comparable range with natural turf, and even exceeding them in some climates (Kanaan et al., 2020).

The heat generated on astroturf fields has direct and varied consequences on human health. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures significantly increases the risk of heat-related illnesses for players and spectators, ranging from heat exhaustion to potentially life-threatening heat strokes (Bergeron et al., 2011). Reports indicate that the elevated surface temperatures of astroturf fields contribute to a heightened risk of heat-related illnesses, resulting in incidents ranging from heat cramps to heat exhaustion and heat strokes (Bergeron et al., 2011). Additionally, studies suggest a higher incidence of ankle and foot injuries on astroturf compared to natural turf, though conflicting reports exist, with some studies facing scrutiny due to their association with the astroturf industry (Kanaan et al., 2020). Concerning respiratory diseases, the synthetic materials used in astroturf, especially under high temperatures, can release harmful chemicals, including carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are neurotoxicants, mutagens, and endocrine disruptors (Murphy & Warner, 2022). Astroturf also significantly impacts freshwater ecotoxicity throughout its use and maintenance more than natural turf (Russo et al., 2022).

In addressing land heating issues like those associated with astroturf, conducting large-scale research and monitoring across extensive areas is often necessary. One standard method for this purpose is satellite imagery, which provides comprehensive data on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) across vast regions. However, utilizing this data for LST analysis presents challenges in data consistency and computational demands. To address these challenges, Google Earth Engine (GEE) has emerged as a valuable platform, leveraging Google's computational resources for remote sensing data analysis. GEE enables users to analyze data directly within the platform, eliminating the need for local data storage (Avdan & Jovanovska, 2016; Ermida et al., 2020).

For conducting this type of research, Landsat 8's Band 10, dedicated to thermal infrared sensing, can be a key component in LST estimation algorithms, offering valuable insights into thermal conditions and values in imagery. These algorithms have shown potential in estimating LST with reasonable accuracy compared to near-surface air temperature measurements. However, it's essential to recognize that LST and near-surface air temperature can differ due to variations in measurement height. Moreover, Landsat 8's spatial resolution, while suitable for many applications, has limitations in capturing fine-scale temperature variations. Nevertheless, Landsat 8 remains a valuable and accurate tool for efficiently assessing Land Surface Temperatures over a wide range of land areas (Avdan & Jovanovska, 2016; Ermida et al., 2020).

In conclusion, this literature review delves into the intricate relationship between astroturf, temperature, health, and climate. Astroturf, often used as a substitute for natural grass in sports facilities and gardens, poses various environmental and health risks. It can become significantly hotter than natural grass, necessitating more water for cooling and potentially releasing harmful chemicals. Prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures on astroturf can lead to heat-related illnesses and an increased risk of injuries. The use of remote sensing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine and Landsat 8 imagery, has proven effective in monitoring land surface temperatures and assessing the heat impact of astroturf.
