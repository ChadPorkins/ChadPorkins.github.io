title: "Weather stations Spatial Join"
---

To locate the nearest weather station for each artificial turf field, the spatial join tool was used in ARC GIS PRO software.

![Figure 2 shows green circles for the artificial turf grass field and red triangles for the weather stations.](LST2.png)

Finally, a data table was created that includes all artificial turf grass fields, the nearest weather station, and the distance between them.

```{r}
Spatial_Join =  read.csv("Spatial_Join.csv")
head(Spatial_Join)
```
