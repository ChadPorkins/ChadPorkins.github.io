title: "Weather stations Spatial Join"
---

To locate the nearest weather station for each artificial turf field, I utilized the spatial join tool within ARC GIS PRO software.

Finally, a table was created which includes all the fields of artificial turf grass, the closest weather station, and the distance between them.

```{r}
Spatial_Join =  read.csv("Spatial_Join.csv")
head(Spatial_Join)
```
