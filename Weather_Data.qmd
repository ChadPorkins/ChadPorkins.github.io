Upon analyzing the table resulting from the Spatial Join, it was found that all artificial turf fields are located near three weather stations.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
Spatial_Join =  read.csv("Spatial_Join.csv")
head(Spatial_Join)
```

```{r}
table(Spatial_Join$Station_ID)
```

The National Weather Service website was utilized to gather climatic data for these stations. The findings revealed that the following three stations are:

-   LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US.

-   NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US.

-   JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY US.

One data frame was created to collect the following climate data in Fahrenheit and Celsius for each weather station:

-   Monthly Mean Max Temperature.

-   Monthly Mean Min Temperature.

-   Monthly Mean Avg.

-   Monthly Total Precipitation.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
Weather_Data = read.csv("Weather_Data.csv")
glimpse(Weather_Data)

```
